extremely basic for now, but I'll add more functionality as I get the chance.

# what it does:
dumps all of your user patches to .syx files. there they can live until I or someone more smarter can figure out a way to put them back on your synth.

# dependencies:
 - mido (`pip install mido`)

# how to use it:
- clone this git repository `git clone https://github.com/r-b-g-b/SH201Librarian.git`
- `cd SH201Librarian`
- `python librarian.py -d DIRECTORY -p PREFIX -n MIDIIOPORTNAME`

`python librarian.py -h` will print mostly this info
